     * If this method is called recursively on the {@link #fastLocked} or {@link #timedLocked} strategy, then dead locks
     * get effectively prevented by temporarily unwinding the stack and releasing all locks for a small random amount of
     * milliseconds.
     * However, this requires some cooperation by the caller <strong>and</strong> the given operation: Both
     * <strong>must</strong> terminate their execution in a consistent state, because a {@link NeedsLockRetryException}
     * may occur anytime!
