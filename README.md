TrueVFS is a virtual file system (VFS) for Java 8 which enables client applications to access archive files as if they 
were virtual directories, including nested archive files in multithreaded environments.
As a library, TrueVFS provides simple, uniform, transparent, thread-safe, read/write access to archive files as if they 
were virtual directories in a file system path.
As a framework, TrueVFS provides the API to write file system drivers which plug-in to its federated file system space.
